## Emoji Analysis: Third Presidential Debate
##### Using NLP to understand what words and emojis use for each candidate

<br/>
***Objective:*** Understand how twitter users communicate using emojis and how it relates to how they feel about each candidate.
<br/>
<br/>
***Tools:*** Python (Pandas, Numpy), Selenium WebDriver, Beautiful Soup, Seaborn
<br/>
<br/>
***Methodology:*** Obtained 1 Million Tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. Removed the re-tweets and identified which emojis were used per tweet. Tracked emoji usage over time and cross examined it with what each candidate said. 
<br/>
<br/>
***Conclusions:*** Overall, Donald Trump gets much more attention, whether it's positive or negative. The biggest spikes in the number of tweets are when he says something or when Hillary Clinton reacts to something he says. In the case of the emojis, the american flag emoji and the laughing crying emoji where the top two most used for both candidates. What is interesting is that for Trump the third is the thinking emoji and for Clinton is the clapping hands. During the debate many people thought about the consequences of what Trump said while they celebrated Hillary for her responses.
